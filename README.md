Audio Steganography Using Signal Processing in MATLAB

Information hiding is a part of information security. Steganography is a technique of information hiding that focuses on hiding the existence of secret messages. The aim of steganographic methods is to hide the existence of the communication and therefore to keep any third-party unaware of the presence of the Steganographic exchange.

Audio steganography requires modification of audio carrier signal in an imperceptible manner. Implementation of Fast Fourier Transform in audio steganography demonstrates that the frequency domain of the audio signal can effectively be used to hide the secret message.

Steganography can be of many types depending upon the type of data encryption being done. Here, I am using using audio signal processing using MATLAB as the stego application for audio steganography. Audio signal processing is a subfield of signal processing that is concerned with the electronic manipulation of audio signals. As audio signals may be represented in either digital or analog format, processing may occur in either domain. Using fast fourier transform technology it is possible to capture the waveform and analyze it for future requirement.
